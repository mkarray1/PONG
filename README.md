# PONG
Try to defeat the intelligent opponent on all three difficulties in the classic 70's game of pong! This project is perhaps
one of my personal favourites. It was my first programming project in which I truly had to rack my brain for a solution.
Without a knowledge of artificial intelligence I had to simulate an intelligent opponent with what I knew. My solution 
ended up being to create an invisibal ball which the opponent would follow and this ball would have a slightly slower speed
than the ball which the user can see. Eventually the invisibal ball would slow down enough for the user to win!
